# AI Quiz Generator

A multi-file game project for GameHUB: an AI-powered quiz generator. This game will allow users to generate quizzes on any topic, answer questions, and get instant feedback. The goal is to make quiz creation and play engaging, with AI-generated questions and answers.

## Core Features
- Generate quizzes on user-specified topics
- Multiple choice and/or open-ended questions
- Instant feedback and scoring
- Clean, interactive UI
- (Optional) Save and review past quizzes

## File Structure
- `index.html` — Main HTML file
- `quiz.js` — Game logic and UI
- `ai.js` — Handles AI question generation (stub for now)
- `style.css` — Styles for the quiz UI

## Next Steps
1. Build the basic UI and quiz flow
2. Implement a stub/mock for AI question generation
3. Add real AI integration (API or local model) when ready
4. Polish UI and add features
